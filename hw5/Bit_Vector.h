// Bit_Vector.h declares a class that extends the STL's
// vector<unsigned char> class to allow binary reading
// and writing of bit vectors.
//
// Since this new Bit_Vector class extends vector<unsigned char>,
// it has these operations (among others):
// - operator[] for usual array access
// - size()
// - push_back() to insert at the back (position size())
// It will resise itself automatically if its capacity is exceeded.
//
// Bit_Vector extends the vector<unsigned char> class by adding
// write(), read(), and operator<<(), below.
